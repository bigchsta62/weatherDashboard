Basic weather dashboard


AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly



When you type in a city name,
you are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.

When you view current weather conditions for that city
Then you are presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, 
the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.



When you view future weather conditions for that city
you are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, 
an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity.

When you click on a city in the search history then you are again 
presented with current and future conditions for that city.

When you come back to the weather dashboard
then you are presented with the last searched city forecast.


This wasn't finished. I missed it and ran out of time.
//WHEN I view the UV index
//THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.
